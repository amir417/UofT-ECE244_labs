# UofT-ECE244_labs (C++)
# This is a second year course taught to ECE students at the University of Toronto.

Your welcomed to use these labs to learn coding. Please note that labs change every year so copying doesn't work. In addition, if you copy, you won't learn anything so you're basically wasting your tuition and that's a big L.

Regardless, happy coding!
